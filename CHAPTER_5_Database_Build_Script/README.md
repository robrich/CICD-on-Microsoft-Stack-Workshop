DATABASE BUILD SCRIPT
=====================

Welcome to the deep end.  This is a challenge, but we've learned enough to accomplish it.

In chapter 2 we built a DevOps pipeline for an app as tasks in TeamCity.

In chapter 3 we built a build script that moved this logic into a batch file.

In chapter 4 we built a DevOps pipeline for a database as tasks in TeamCity.

Your challenge now is to create a build script for the database build, create a TeamCity build to run this script, and create an Octopus Deploy configuration to deploy this database.

Hint 1: How did we identify the steps in the build script?

Hint 2: How did we find the commands for each task?
