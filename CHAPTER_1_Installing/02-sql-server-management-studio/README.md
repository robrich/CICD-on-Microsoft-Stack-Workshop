SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT STUDIO (SSMS)
===================================

In past versions, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) was part of the SQL install disk.  It's now a separate download because it is now free where the SQL Server engine is still paid.

Install
-------

1. Download [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms)

2. Launch `SSMS-Setup-ENU.exe`.

3. Push next, and complete the install.  Because it uses the Visual Studio 2017 shell, this takes a long time.

4. Restart the machine when prompted.


Test it out
-----------

We haven't installed SQL Server yet, so we can't test it. Let's install SQL Server next.
