OTHER TOOLS
===========

To help manage the server, you may choose to install other tools.  Here's some of my favorites:

- [7 Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) - easier than the extract wizard in Windows. Launch `7z1900-x64.exe` to install.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - you could also choose Notepad++, Atom, Brackets, Visual Studio Code, or a number of others.  You'll want one that can preserve Unix-style line endings, so avoid Notepad. Launch `VSCodeUserSetup-`bunch-of-numbers`.exe` to install.

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) - you could also choose Firefox, Edge, or any modern browser. Launch `ChromeSetup.exe` to install.
